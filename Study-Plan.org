- Database: Database Internals
- DSA: Algorithm Design Manual

* A Note About Trimestral Capstone Projects
A sample project is listed at the end of every trimester which can be used to be the capstone project of the learner. It is however encouraged that the learner thinks of his/her own capstone project that covers the core topics discussed/learned.

* Year 1

** T1: Core IaC, Cloud, & Scripting

*** Offline Reading
- The Phoenix Project (DevOps principles)
- Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes (Conceptual IaC/cloud mindsets)

*** AWS Basics and Linux/Bash Scripting
Resources:
- Adrian Cantrill AWS Course
- The Linux Command Line
- OverTheWire Bandit
- SadServers Scenarios

Exercises:
- Set up AWS free tier
- Provision EC2 via CLI
- Create bash scripts for AWS tasks (e.g., monitor with AWS CLI)
- Build a simple bash script to monitor a local process and log output

Read OSTEP chapters on /processes/ (Ch.1-4)

**** Standalone Project: AWS Resource Auditor
Script to list/inventory AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets) using AWS CLI and Bash for parsing/output.

Objectives:
- [ ] Practice CLI integration, error handling, and basic automation.
- [ ] Deliver a runnable script with sample output.

*** Tech Fundamentals
High level overview on technical fundamentals.

Follow Adrian Cantrill's course on tech fundamentals.

**** Standalone Project: Network Diagnostic Tool
Simple bash script to test connectivity (e.g. ping, traceroute) and output basic security checks (e.g., open ports via nmap).

Objectives:
- [ ] Apply OSI concepts
- [ ] Deliver scripts with test scenarios

*** Infrastructure as Code and TypeScript Basics
Resources:
- Terraform Up & Running
- Pulumi documentation & tutorials
- TypeScript: The Definitive Guide

Exercises:
- Provision AWS VPC/EC2 with Terraform/Pulumi

**** Standalone Project: IaC Provisioner Module
A reusable Terraform/Pulumi module for a basic VPC/subnet setup.

Objectives:
- [ ] Practice declarative code
- [ ] Deliver module with variables and outputs for reuse

*** Ansible and Automation with Go Introduction
Resource:
- Ansible for DevOps
- The Go Programming Language

Exercises:
- Configure EC2 with Ansible
- Integrate Terraform
- Add security: Introduction to DevSpecOps -- use Trivy to scan Ansible playbooks for vulnerabilities.
- Go scripts for AWS SDK

**** Standalone Project: Automation Playbook
An Ansible playbook to install/configure a Go runtime on EC2 and run a basic script.

Objectives:
- [ ] Idempotency and security scans
- [ ] Deliver a playbook with test run logs

*** Certification Prep
Prep for AWS Certification Exam

*** Capstone Project

**** Sample Project: Cloud Resource Manager
A Go CLI tool (with bash wrapper) that uses IaC (Terraform/Pulumi) to provision/audit AWS resources, incorporating Ansible for configuration and basic security scans.

Goals:
- [ ] Synthesize scripting, IaC, and automation
- [ ] Deliver a tool that lists/provisions/tears down resources with logs and error handling
- [ ] Test on free tier
- [ ] Publish to GitHub with a README and demo
