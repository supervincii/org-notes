** T1: Core IaC, Cloud, & Scripting

*** Offline Reading
- The Phoenix Project (DevOps principles)
- Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes (Conceptual IaC/cloud mindsets)

*** AWS Basics and Linux/Bash Scripting
Resources:
- Adrian Cantrill AWS Course
- The Linux Command Line

Exercises:
- Set up AWS free tier
- Provision EC2 via CLI
- Create bash scripts for AWS tasks (e.g., monitor with AWS CLI)

Read OSTEP chapters on /processes/ (Ch.1-4)

*** Tech Fundamentals
High level overview on technical fundamentals.

Follow Adrian Cantrill's course on tech fundamentals.

*** Infrastructure as Code
Resource
- Terraform Up & Running
- Pulumi documentation & tutorials

Exercises:
- Provision AWS VPC/EC2 with Terraform/Pulumi

Language Integration: TypeScript basics ("TypeScript: The Definitive Guide" Ch.1-3)

*** Ansible and Automation
Resource: Ansible for DevOps

Exercises:
- Configure EC2 with Ansible
- Integrate Terraform

Add Security: Introduction to DevSpecOps -- use Trivy to scan Ansible playbooks for vulnerabilities.

*** Introduction to Go
Resource: The Go Programming Language

Exercises:
- Go scripts for AWS SDK (e.g., S3 uploads)

Integrate with Adrian Cantrill's course.  

*** Certification Prep
Prep for AWS Certification Exam

*** Capstone Project
- Provision multi-cloud (AWS/GCP) using Terraform/Pulumi
- Deploy Go service on EC2 with Ansible
- Add Go API endpoints
- Add basic security scan
- Publish to GitHub
- Write a mock RFC for your project (e.g., design documentation)
- Attempt a small open-source contribution

**** Project Rubrics
- Functionality:
  - Infrastructure provisions successfully
  - Go service runs and handles basic requests (e.g., HTTP GET/POST)
  - No errors on deployment
- Best Practices:
  - Uses idempotent Ansible playbooks
  - Include IAM roles and Trivy scans
  - Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- Documentation:
  - README with setup instructions
  - Architecture diagram (use Draw.io or any other diagram tools)
  - Commit history should be clean
    - Look into squashing commits when merging iteration branches
  - Another engineer should be able to replicate in <1 hour
- Self-Assessment:
  - Create a self-assessment doc
